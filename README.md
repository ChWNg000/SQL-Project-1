## SQL-Project-1

Welcome, this is my SQL project where I query on a  sample database representing a database for a film rental business. The link can be found 
here https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/

Here's the E-R diagram for the database, provided by the website.

## Goal
The purpose of the project was to examine what the relationship between the total rental revenue made by each film and factors like
the genre of the film, age-restrictions on the film and the rental rate.

## Queries
-The first query gives a table each film's id, category id, title, rental rate, rental duration, and total rental income/revenue
generated by the film. The table has 958 entries and is sorted in descending order of total rental revenue. Since total
rental revenue was not counted in the original database, I use this table frequently in my other queries.

-The second query gives a table providing some summary statistics. It tells us how much total rental revenue 
is correlated with the rental rate under the "corr" column, where the correlation between total rental revenue and rental rate
is given. Other summary statistics like the mean total revenue and standard deviation was obtained for the films queried from 
Query 1.

-The third query evaluates the effect of genre on the revenue produced by the film. We look at the average amount of revenue
for films each genre, and find that Sci Fi and Comedy movies appear to do the best. We see that Family and Children's
films make less money from the rental. This might lead one to think of whether age restrictions are related to the revenue
generated by the film. That's the subject of the last query.

-The fourth query looks at the average revenue of films in each age rating and also tells us whether the average revenue of films
within a given age rating is greater than or less than the average revenue of any film queried in Query 1. Interestingly, PG and
PG-13 films had higher than average revenue. This ought to be investigated since it's not what one might expect after seeing the
third query.

Thanks for reading!
